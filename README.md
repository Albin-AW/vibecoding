It's an assignment, calm down.


#Promt 1
You're on a test right now, specifically for you.
Create HTML, CSS, and possibly JS if needed.
These are the instructions:
    A logo (text),
    A menu with three links (Home, About us, Contact)
    A body section with header and button
    A footer with copyright text

I want you to create a very magnificent and unique website with these requirements and I want it to be very cool. It does not need to be responsive to other layouts.

#Prompt 2
Wonderful Job DeepSeek.
There's some things that I want you to add.
I love what you've done, but add some clickable links and if required, create more html's on the clickable links are add information corresponding with what you've written.

Make it cooler.
