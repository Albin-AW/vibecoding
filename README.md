It's an assignment, calm down.


#Promt 1
You're on a test right now, specifically for you.
Create HTML, CSS, and possibly JS if needed.
These are the instructions:
    A logo (text),
    A menu with three links (Home, About us, Contact)
    A body section with header and button
    A footer with copyright text

I want you to create a very magnificent and unique website with these requirements and I want it to be very cool. It does not need to be responsive to other layouts.



#Prompt 2
Wonderful Job DeepSeek.
There's some things that I want you to add.
I love what you've done, but add some clickable links and if required, create more html's on the clickable links are add information corresponding with what you've written.

Make it cooler.



#Prompt 3 (Table)
I have some other things you want to add.
I want you to a table with 2 columns and 5 rows with the with prices included for our services and what we do for our job.
You can do it anywhere you want, you can make it how fantastic as you want, but make it look good.



#Prompt 4 (Light & Dark Mode) -- Started a New Prompt (It broke)
Ah, I forgot to mention. Can you add a pressable button that does not look bad, with a feature that changes between light & dark mode on all surfaces. I want the default color (dark-ish) which it is right now.
I just want it to have a light mode feature that can always be turned on & off on all places of the website.
You can add it wherever you want.
